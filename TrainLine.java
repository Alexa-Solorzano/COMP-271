/**
* During class I make sure that I am fully engaged through my note taking. I ensure to take intensive notes each time I attend class.
* I write down what professor Leo is explaining, I take moments to just understand the metaphors, and I write down my own suggestions/ideas.
* I use these notes to reflect and connect to the themes of the week's assignment. I also make sure to look over the material from the previous week.
* I understand that many of the topics learned are built on top of each other, and connect as we learn more. 
* I have never had homework that is assigned on Friday and is due the next week. I think Iâ€™ve been caught in the cycle of not looking at the assignment until Monday.
* I think moving forward I need to account for myself to look over the assignment over the weekend. I am trying to evolve my style of coding with the new style shown in the solutions.
* I am trying to elevate my coding style to simplify the code. I come to class every week, and the only times I have missed have been due to health-related issues that I let Professor Leo know beforehand via emails.
* Based on this reflection, I expect my course grade to be a B-.
